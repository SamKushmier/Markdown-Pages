We're Soda Den, a small game studio run by two brothers, Timo and Jhony. Roots of Pacha was born from our memories of passing the controller back and forth while playing Harvest Moon and dreaming of making our own game. The inspiration for a stone-age experience comes from the book "The Clan of the Cave Bear." How we, humans, tuned into nature and used our imagination to create the once inconceivable. That one crazy "Idea" built on another, and another, eventually leading us to grand civilizations.
